# Interlynk-Network

  We are building a Decentralized P2P network for IoT connectivity, called as Interlynk. Anybody with a Smartphone can participate as a node and provide connectivity to the surrounding IoT devices and get rewarded with our Native tokens.
  Rather than relying on a dedicated telecom network like 5G and LPWAN operators, Interlynk Network uses existing "Smartphone Infrastructure" for secured communication of IoT devices. Interlynk uses existing infrastructure to deploy a unique IoT network, instead of deploying new antennas and adding to hardware costs.


## What problem is Interlynk solving?
- Centralized: IoT platforms come with their Centralized network and cloud infrastructure, lacking interoperability capabilities.
- High Power Consumption: Most of the long range connectivity networks create further issue of Higher Power consumption.
- Higher costs: High hardware and recurring costs of various networks make it unviable for many projects.


## Features

- Giving unique identity to all IoT devices on Interlynkâ€™s blockchain network
- Drastically reducing the overall costs and energy consumption
- Interlynk generates IoT connectivity using the edge-computation principles
- Easy login methods - including Google, Twitter, Inbuilt ERC 20 Crypto Wallet , etc
- User-friendly UI
- Minting & Burning Functions in Smart Contract
- Full Transparent Reward mechanism
